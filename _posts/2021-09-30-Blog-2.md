# HTML

The meaning of HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the primary markup language used to create web pages. HTML was first developed by Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and others in 1989. HTML was originally created to semantically describe scientific texts. Throughout the years, HTML adapted to various other types of documents for its general design.

HTML uses markup to display text, images, and other content in the web browser. Special elements in HTML markup include the `<head>`, `<title>`, `<body>`, `<header>`, etc. The HTML element is defined by a tag and some content. The tag consists of the element name and enclosed by "<" and ">". The purpose of the HTML element is to show how to display the content.

The Structure of an HTML Page is shown below:

There are several HTML elements. These elements are the basics of HTML:
`<!DOCTYPE html>` - This element shows the language that the page is written in, which is an HTML5 document. All HTML documents must start with this declaration to help browsers successfully display the right web page.

`<html>` - This element is the root element of the HTML page. It defines the page as a HTML document.

`<title>` - This element specifies the title for the HTML page.

`<head>` - This includes the metadata about the page.

`<body>` - The body establishes the content of the page, such as headings, images, paragraphs, etc. This element is the visible pat of the HTML document. The `<body>` is inside the `<html>` element.

`<h1>` - This element defines a large first heading. HTML headings are defined as `<h1>` to `<h6>`. The `<h1>` is the first and most important heading and `<h6>` is the least important heading. The `<h1>` element is inside the `<body>` element.

`<p>` - This defines a paragraph. The `<p>` element is also included inside the `<body>` element.
