## JSON Introduction

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a form to share data. JSON is derived from the JavaScript programming language, yet it can be used in various programming languages, including Java, PHP, Python, and Ruby. JSON is human readable and writable, and machines can easily parse and generate. 

JSON utilizes the `.json` extension. It can occur inside quotes as a JSON string or as an object given to a variable when declared in another file type (such as `.html`). This format is simple to send from a web server to a client or browser. JSON is an alternative to XML since it is more readable and requires less formatting.

## JSON Syntax 

A JSON object is a data format that uses curly brackets to represent key-value pairs. When working with JSON, JSON objects are in a `.json` files, but they may also exist as a JSON object or string.

Here's is an example of a JSON object:

The format is usually set up with two curly brackets on either end of it, and with key-value pairs are inside the space in between. Each key-value paid is separated by a comma (`"key" : "value`). JSON keys need to have double quotation marks, and can be a valid string. However, JSON values need to be either a strings, numbers, arrays, objects, Booleans, or null. Most data used in JSON is wrapped in a JSON object.

## Comparison to XML

The eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is a format for storing data. XLM is also readable by humans and machines. The XML format is supported by a various computer programming languages.

XML is similar to JSON, but it requires more text, so it's lengthier and takes longer to read and write. Unlike JSON, XML does not support arrays. Previously stated, JSON is much easier to read and require less formatting that XML. 

Here's an example of the XML format:
