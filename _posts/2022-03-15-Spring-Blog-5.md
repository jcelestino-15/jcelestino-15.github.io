# Amazon Web Services 
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a popular cloud computing platform provided by Amazon. AWS offers many different cloud computing products and services. AWS provides servers, compute power, database storage, and network and content delivery. 

## Services 

### Compute
There are several popular compute services such as EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud), ECS (Elastic Container Service), EKS (Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes), Lambda, and Elastic Beanstalk. The Amazon EC2 provides resizable virtual machines. Amazon ECS is a highly scalable container service that allows users to run Docker containers in the cloud. Amazon EKS allows you to run managed Kubernetes on AWS. AWS Lambda is a serverless compute solution. AWS Elastic Beanstalk provides a simple way to run and manage web applications.

### Storage
One of the storage services AWS provides are S3 (Simple Storage Service), EFS (Elastic File System), and Glacier. Amazon S3 stores objects like files, folders, images, etc. The Amazon EFS provides storage for EC2 instances. The Amazon S3 Glacier provides an extremely low-cost cloud storage service for data archiving and long-term backup.

### Database
A few of the database services offered in AWS are Relational Database Service (RDS), DynamoDB, and Redshift. Amazon RDS offers a managed service that sets up and operates a relational database in the cloud. Amazon DynamoDB is a highly scalable NoSQL database service for any scale. Amazon Redshift is a fast, fully managed data warehouse that makes it simple and cost-effective to analyze all data by using standard SQL and existing business intelligence tools**. 

### Networking and Content Delivery 
AWS offers such networking and content delivery services such as Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), Route53, and CloudFront. Amazon VPC is a data center in the cloud in which you deploy all resources. Amazon Route53 is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service where you can register domain names. CloudFront is a fast content delivery service that delivers data to customers at high transfer speeds.

### The Benefits of AWS
- User-friendly - AWS has a user-friendly interface called the AWS Management Console. It’s easy to use as AWS is designed for quick and secure access.
- Flexible - AWS allows you to select the operating system, programming language, database, and other services that you need. There is no limit to how much you can use. 
- Cost-effective - AWS follows a pay-as-you-go pricing model. You only pay for the services that you use. There are no long-term contracts. It is more cost effective than the traditional computing method. 
- Secure - AWS provides security for their infrastructure to ensure privacy of data. 
- Scalable - Applications can scale up or down based on the user’s demand. Users can add and access new resources within minutes.
