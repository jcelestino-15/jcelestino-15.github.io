## Ansible

This week, I became familiar with Ansible for the CIT480 lab. I had only worked with Ansible for a lab in CIT496P. In CIT496P, the lab helped to show how to use the ec2 module in an ansible playbook. The CIT480 reintroduced the work with ansible playbook. For my initial set up, I ultimately used a Docker container to test the ansible playbooks. I originally was going to test through the Ubuntu virtual machine to test the apache.yml, but I encountered errors. I switched to using a Docker container for the lab since it was better to use as I can use it for more practice on using Docker and creating Dockerfiles. Creating the apache.yml was simple because I only had to install and start apache, and I had to look up the list of apache2 modules to install specific modules. The prometheus.yml file required more research since I was not too familiar with the modules used in Ansible. I used the prometheus/node exporter lab as a template to create the playbook. I ran the ansible playbook in a chosent test environment, and it was successful as the prometheus.yml was updated. My errors in the prometheus.yml file were only typos. 

Ansible is an open source automation tool. Ansible is a tool that enables Infrastructure as a Code (IaC). It automates application deployment, cloud provisioning, configure system, and even more advanced IT tasks. Ansible is agentless, so it functions by connecting through SSH to the clients. Ansible playbooks are used to manage IT processes. Ansible playbooks are saved as .yaml files. They are configured as sets of plays, so a playbook can contain one or more plays. Plays are used to organize the set of instructions against a specific host. All ansible playbooks contain one or more tasks to be executed; each task is linked to a module.  

Here is an example of an Ansible playbook:
