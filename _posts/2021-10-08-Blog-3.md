## Dockerfile

 In the past week, I have been learning about Dockerfile in both CIT480 and CIT384. For the CIT480 lab, I was able to create a custom Docker image using a Dockerfile. Lab 2 was similar to the previous lab-we had to include the Prometheus and Node Exporter packages; however, it was much easier to do since we were able to create a custom Docker image under a Dockerfile. I did not have issues with creating a Dockerfile nor when building the container. For the CIT384, the new lab helps re-familiarize with common docker commands and Dockerfile to create the new website within a new container. The container required the Apache httpd server and the index.html, which was our resume file in html. To run the appropriate docker command, I had to typed:

    docker build -t my_resume git@github.com:CIT384/z_containerized-website-jcc65664.git#main
    
    docker run -dit --name resume.site -p 8080:80 my_resume

I ran into a problem when I was trying to run the Dockerfile and testing it. I originally ran the command as `docker build -t my_resume git@github.com:CIT384/z_containerized-website-jcc65664.git` , however a classmate told me that we are supposed to add #main at the end of the url. 


A Dockerfile is a text file that has no file extension. Here is an example of a Dockerfile:

Here is some of the few commands that I have used within Dockerfile

`FROM` - This command is used to define the operating system that will be the base image. The FROM command must be the first command in the Dockerfile.

`RUN` - The RUN command is what runs within the container at build time. It is to install applications and packages to be part of the image when building the Docker image.

`COPY` - The COPY command is used to copy files to the Docker image.

`CMD` - As Docker runs the Docker container from the image, the CMD command is used to execute the commands. However, Docker can only run one CMD command.
